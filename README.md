# AI-Introduction and Capabilities

  AI is a software its imitates human behaviours and capabilities. It has multiple workloads.

  ### Machine Learning 
  
   - Its a foundation of AI system throuh which we teach AI system make prediction and draw conclusion based on provided data model.

       - In Machine Learning the basic building bloc is data set. In today's world we have a large voulme of data set about any topic.
       - For any given category that category data is organized with different lables these grouping will have its features under the lable.
       - Then there is an algorithm will build around this data set which identifies relationship between these labeled data set based on it feature and this algorithm will be encapsulated as model about that category.
       - Then based on this trained algoritham it can able to predicte and provide result.
    
         ### Azure Machine Learning Service
         - A cloud based service which helps to create, mangae, publish machine learning models.
         - Azure Machine Learning Studio offers multiple tools to create these models.
              - Automated Machine Learning - A tool to help create machine learning models with no expertise in the filed of AI.
              - Azure Machine Learning Designer - A graphical interface to enable no code platform for data model creation.
              - Data metric visulaiztion - A tool to analyze and optimize the data model experiment process.
              - Notebooks - A runtime integrated with Azure Machine Learning Studio based on Jupyter Notebook servers used to write code and run.

  ### Computer vision

  - Its a capabaility of AI system which interpret the world through vidoes, images, videso etc (Visuval capability).

     - Computer vision is an AI division which deals with Visual processing. **Seeing AI** app is an exampled of the same.
     - Computer vision solutions are based on machine learning models that can be applied on Visuals like images, videos. These macine learning models will perform following tasks.
   
          - Image Classification - Involves train a model to make it idenitify and categorize given image based on thier content. Ex in a traffic monitoring solution based on the image it can classify the image based on its content. Wheather given image is car, bus etc.
          - Object Detection - In this type machine learning models are trained to to identify/classify objects in a given image and their location. Ex in a traffic monitoring application based on image it can identify different objects in the image based on their location.
          - Semantic Segmantation - In this individual pixels in the images are classified according to each object in the image. Ex in a image it will idenitfy each object color like Red bus, Blue Car etc.
          - Image analysis - In this category by combining different AI models we can create descriptive image text for a given image.
          - Face Detection, Analysis and Recognition - This type of machine learning models can identify humean face from the images based on their features.
          - Optical Character Recognation - Its a technique to detect and read text in a given image.

     - Using Azuer AI  Vision we can create AI based solution for Visuals.

          - **Azuer AI  Vision**  will support Image Analysis, Face recognition, and Optical Character Recognition.

  ### Natural Language Processing

  - Its a capability of AI system where computer/machine will interpret spoken (voice) or written (text) and respond in kind.

  ### Document Intelligence

  - Its a capability of AI system where computer/machine will process/mange large volume of data which is in document form.

  ### Knowledge Minning

  - Its a capability of AI system where it process large volume of unstructured data from which it creates a knowledge base.

 ### Generative AI

  - Its a capability of AI system it automatically create original conent in the form of text, image, visuals, code etc.
