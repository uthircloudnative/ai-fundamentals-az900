# AI-Introduction and Capabilities

  AI is a software its imitates human behaviours and capabilities. It has multiple workloads.

  ### Machine Learning 
  
   - Its a foundation of AI system throuh which we teach AI system make prediction and draw conclusion based on provided data model.

       - In Machine Learning the basic building bloc is data set. In today's world we have a large voulme of data set about any topic.
       - For any given category that category data is organized with different lables these grouping will have its features under the lable.
       - Then there is an algorithm will build around this data set which identifies relationship between these labeled data set based on it feature and this algorithm will be encapsulated as model about that category.
       - Then based on this trained algoritham it can able to predicte and provide result. 

  ### Computer vision

  - Its a capabaility of AI system which interpret the world through vidoes, images, videso etc (Visuval capability).

  ### Natural Language Processing

  - Its a capability of AI system where computer/machine will interpret spoken (voice) or written (text) and respond in kind.

  ### Document Intelligence

  - Its a capability of AI system where computer/machine will process/mange large volume of data which is in document form.

  ### Knowledge Minning

  - Its a capability of AI system where it process large volume of unstructured data from which it creates a knowledge base.

 ### Generative AI

  - Its a capability of AI system it automatically create original conent in the form of text, image, visuals, code etc.
